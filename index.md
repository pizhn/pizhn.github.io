## About Me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). My research interests lie in developing modern machine learning algorithms robust to distribution shifts.
